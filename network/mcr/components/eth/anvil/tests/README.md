# Tests

Tests are used to test the protocol.

- [`basic`](./basic/README.md): Bring up a basic network.
- [`test2`](./test2/README.md): Stake MOVE tokens from a validator, post a commitment, and then post confirm the commitment.

Once a test is finalized, it should be added to the `tests.yml` file in the `.github` folder of the repository.
