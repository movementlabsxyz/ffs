# `protocol-units`

`protocol-units` are used to collect runnable and composable units for interacting with the `ffs` protocol. We store contracts within protocol units, for example.

## Contents

- **[`mcr`](./mcr/README.md)**: the `MCR` implementation of `ffs` provided prior to the specification of the `fcp` and `pcp` protocols. It is maintained for legacy purposes.
- **[`pcp`](./pcp/README.md)**: the postconfirmation sub-protocol implementation for `ffs`.
- **[`fastconfirmation`](./fcp/README.md)**: the fastconfirmation sub-protocol implementation for `ffs`.
